  "Summary": "Following the band's inception in the late '90s, Seattle hardcore unit Akimbo took to the road, relentlessly touring the country over the years and leaving a path of destruction in its wake. The band -- comprised of Jared Burke Eglington (guitar), Jon Weisnewski (bass/vocals), and Nat Damm (drums) -- credited the thunderous intensity and sonic explosion of its music to influences ranging from the classic rock of Black Sabbath and Led Zeppelin to the attitudes of Black Flag and the Melvins. Working with various labels over the course of about five years, Akimbo issued four releases -- Army of Evil Robots Programmed for Human Destruction 7\", Harshing Your Mellow, City of the Stars, and Elephantine. Early 2006 found the hard-working band issuing its fifth ruthless album, Forging Steel and Laying Stone, through its new home at Alternative Tentacles; the record featured second guitarist Patrick Cunningham. Touring followed the release, including dates supporting Plot to Blow Up the Eiffel Tower. Out of print since its original 2001 release, Harshing Your Mellow was later reissued in February 2007 and the band (now down to trio status with Aaron Walters handling guitar) supported it with more rounds of shows. That September, Alternative Tentacles released the band's heaviest record to date, Navigating the Bronze. ~ Corey Apar"

  "Summary": "A notoriously enigmatic band hailing from Pennsylvania, Black Moth Super Rainbow made waves on the indie circuit with their unique brand of otherworldly, psychedelic indie pop. The band employ typical rock band instrumentation in addition to a bevy of vintage synthesizers, with all of the vocals sung through a vocoder. Additionally, the group coat everything in hazy effects and tape hiss, resulting in music as grimy and disorienting as it is catchy. The group have built up a dedicated fan base through touring as well as their acclaimed recordings, which are often released through their own labels in limited editions. The group's leader, Tobacco, has also launched a successful solo career.\r\nThe project evolved out of a duo called Satanstompingcaterpillars, which began in Pittsburgh in 2000 and consisted of Tobacco and Power Pill Fist. The group expanded to include five members (including the Seven Fields of Aphelion, Iffernaut, and Father Hummingbird), and changed their name to Black Moth Super Rainbow in 2003. Packing a sound that nodded to contemporary retro-chic electronic acts like Air and the Octopus Project (who they would eventually collaborate with), the group released its first album, Falling Through a Field, on its own 70s Gymnastics Recording Co. Basing its operations in an undisclosed location somewhere in rural Pennsylvania, the group signed to Georgia-based Graveface Records and released two more albums, Start a People and Lost Picking Flowers in the Woods, over the course of the next three years. A critically acclaimed collaboration with the Octopus Project, 2006's The House of Apples and Eyeballs, combined with a successful debut at that year's SXSW launched the group into the indie limelight. Their sticky, rainbow-tinted fourth release, Dandelion Gum, hit stores the following year.\r\nAfter Tobacco released the 2008 solo album Fucked Up Friends on Anticon, the band regrouped with producer Dave Fridmann and recorded its slickest, most accessible record to date, 2009's Eating Us. The band shuffled its lineup and issued several EPs in the next few years, and even completed work on an album called Psychic Love Damage, which was scrapped shortly after it was finished because the band didn't find it too exciting once it was done. Without a label, they instead launched a Kickstarter campaign to help fund the release of 2012's Cobra Juicy, offering donating fans rewards such as hideous masks with USB flash drives containing MP3s of the new album jutting out in place of teeth. The album arrived via the group's own Rad Cult imprint, which also released an EP of tracks intended for Psychic Love Damage.\r\nAfter the group toured behind Cobra Juicy, Tobacco signed to Ghostly International as a solo artist and released two more full-lengths. BMSR released an EP titled SeeFu Lilac in 2016, as well as a split single with Freescha. The group made their proper return with 2018 full-length Panic Blooms, a typically sinister yet blissful reaction to the state of the world. ~ Paul Simpson"

BMSR released an EP titled SeeFu Lilac in 2016, as well as a split single with Freescha. The group made their proper return with 2018 full-length Panic Blooms, a typically sinister yet blissful reaction to the state of the world. ~ Paul Simpson"

  "Summary": "Crafting moody and introspective lo-fi pop tunes that are melodic but structurally ambitious at the same time, Car Seat Headrest is the moniker used by musician and songwriter Will Toledo. Cutting his teeth creating D.I.Y. recordings on inexpensive home equipment, Toledo's songwriting -- deeply personal, sometimes dramatic, frequently witty, and dotted with unexpected social and cultural references -- was what stood out as he gained confidence and strength on self-released early projects such as 2010's Little Pieces of Paper with \"No\" Written on Them. 2011's Twin Fantasy was Car Seat Headrest's breakthrough work, a song cycle that was a major step forward for the young songwriter. 2015's Teens of Style was the group's first album for Matador Records, and though the LP earned positive reviews, it was 2016's Teens of Denial that seriously wowed critics and established him as an artist to watch in indie rock. 2020's Making a Door Less Open was an effort to expand the boundaries of Car Seat Headrest's music, with lo-fi indie sounds giving way to a more expert approach dominated by electronic instrumentation. It was a process they continued on the 2021 companion EP's MADLO: Influences and MADLO: Remixes, and the 2022 tour which reflected their new sound was documented on the live album Faces from the Masquerade, issued in December 2023.\nWill Toledo grew up in Leesburg, Virginia, where he learned about music theory while playing in the student symphony band in junior high and high school. He majored in English in college but was fascinated with music, embracing an eclectic variety of artists from Radiohead, Modest Mouse, and R.E.M. to Animal Collective and Swans, and he began writing songs on his computer, using its built-in microphone and the recording software that was bundled with the machine. While Toledo's recording setup became more advanced with time, he continued to prefer simpler solutions to recording problems, and his project became known as Car Seat Headrest when Toledo found he was more comfortable recording vocals in his car than in his home. As he began playing live shows with a rotating team of musicians (when a reporter asked Toledo about being a fixture on the local scene, he replied, \"All that amounts to is being able to play at the local pizza place\"), the vast majority of his recordings were cut at home with Toledo handling all the vocals and instruments himself.\r\nIn May 2010, he issued his first Car Seat Headrest album, titled 1, with 2, 3, and 4 all appearing within the next three months. Although Toledo would continue to make his first four LPs available through his online store, he sheepishly included a warning to potential customers that they were \"not very good.\" December 2010 brought Little Pieces of Paper with \"No\" Written on Them, which Toledo described as \"B-sides and rarities and generally just awful shit,\" but with March 2011's My Back Is Killing Me Baby, Toledo finally made an album he felt didn't require a warning about its inferior quality, and Car Seat Headrest began winning the attention of critics and lo-fi fans around the world with Twin Fantasy, released in November 2011.\r\nThe year 2012 brought two more albums, Monomania and Starving While Living, and in August 2013, Toledo released Nervous Young Man. Deciding he needed to break away from the places where he grew up and studied, Toledo left Virginia and moved to Seattle, where he assembled a new lineup of Car Seat Headrest and continued to busy himself with home recording. October 2014 brought another particularly personal project, How to Leave Town, which earned enthusiastic reviews on the music blogosphere and led to Toledo signing a deal with Matador Records. The label issued Teens of Style, featuring new versions of several of Car Seat Headrest's older tunes, in October 2015.\r\nIn May 2016, Toledo released an album of new Car Seat Headrest material, Teens of Denial. The record, which melded lo-fi noisemaking with a clean and ambitious production, made music news headlines shortly before its release. One of the album's tracks, \"Just What I Needed/Not What I Needed,\" interpolated a few bars of the Cars' classic \"Just What I Needed.\" At the last minute, Cars frontman and songwriter Ric Ocasek rescinded his permission for Car Seat Headrest to use the excerpt from his song. The initial run of Teens of Denial on vinyl and CD had to be destroyed, but the digital version of the album was released as scheduled, with the problematic track replaced with a reworked version of \"Not What I Needed.\" The album received widespread acclaim, serving as a breakout for Toledo.\r\nCuriously, he returned in early 2018 not with a new LP but with an entirely re-recorded version of Car Seat Headrest's fan-favorite 2011 album Twin Fantasy. The following year saw the release of the group's first concert LP, Commit Yourself Completely. 2020's Making a Door Less Open found Toledo shifting stylistic gears, with electronics dominating the arrangements and giving the music a smoother, more refined sound. Two companion EPs, MADLO: Influences (a covers album) and MADLO: Remixes, arrived in June 2021. While the COVID-19 pandemic prevented Car Seat Headrest from touring extensively in support of the album, in 2022 they were back to performing live, and they played a three-night stand at New York's Brooklyn Steel in March of that year. The shows were recorded, and a collection of highlights from the concerts was released in December 2023, Faces from the Masquerade. ~ Mark Deming"

It was a process they continued on the 2021 companion EP's MADLO: Influences and MADLO: Remixes, and the 2022 tour which reflected their new sound was documented on the live album Faces from the Masquerade, issued in December 2023.\nWill Toledo grew up in Leesburg, Virginia, where he learned about music theory while playing in the student symphony band in junior high and high school. He majored in English in college but was fascinated with music, embracing an eclectic variety of artists from Radiohead, Modest Mouse, and R.E.M. to Animal Collective and Swans, and he began writing songs on his computer, using its built-in microphone and the recording software that was bundled with the machine. While Toledo's recording setup became more advanced with time, he continued to prefer simpler solutions to recording problems, and his project became known as Car Seat Headrest when Toledo found he was more comfortable recording vocals in his car than in his home. As he began playing live shows with a rotating team of musicians (when a reporter asked Toledo about being a fixture on the local scene, he replied, \"All that amounts to is being able to play at the local pizza place\"), the vast majority of his recordings were cut at home with Toledo handling all the vocals and instruments himself.\r\nIn May 2010, he issued his first Car Seat Headrest album, titled 1, with 2, 3, and 4 all appearing within the next three months. Although Toledo would continue to make his first four LPs available through his online store, he sheepishly included a warning to potential customers that they were \"not very good.\" December 2010 brought Little Pieces of Paper with \"No\" Written on Them, which Toledo described as \"B-sides and rarities and generally just awful shit,\" but with March 2011's My Back Is Killing Me Baby, Toledo finally made an album he felt didn't require a warning about its inferior quality, and Car Seat Headrest began winning the attention of critics and lo-fi fans around the world with Twin Fantasy, released in November 2011.\r\nThe year 2012 brought two more albums, Monomania and Starving While Living, and in August 2013, Toledo released Nervous Young Man. Deciding he needed to break away from the places where he grew up and studied, Toledo left Virginia and moved to Seattle, where he assembled a new lineup of Car Seat Headrest and continued to busy himself with home recording. October 2014 brought another particularly personal project, How to Leave Town, which earned enthusiastic reviews on the music blogosphere and led to Toledo signing a deal with Matador Records. The label issued Teens of Style, featuring new versions of several of Car Seat Headrest's older tunes, in October 2015.\r\nIn May 2016, Toledo released an album of new Car Seat Headrest material, Teens of Denial. The record, which melded lo-fi noisemaking with a clean and ambitious production, made music news headlines shortly before its release. One of the album's tracks, \"Just What I Needed/Not What I Needed,\" interpolated a few bars of the Cars' classic \"Just What I Needed.\" At the last minute, Cars frontman and songwriter Ric Ocasek rescinded his permission for Car Seat Headrest to use the excerpt from his song. The initial run of Teens of Denial on vinyl and CD had to be destroyed, but the digital version of the album was released as scheduled, with the problematic track replaced with a reworked version of \"Not What I Needed.\" The album received widespread acclaim, serving as a breakout for Toledo.\r\nCuriously, he returned in early 2018 not with a new LP but with an entirely re-recorded version of Car Seat Headrest's fan-favorite 2011 album Twin Fantasy. The following year saw the release of the group's first concert LP, Commit Yourself Completely. 2020's Making a Door Less Open found Toledo shifting stylistic gears, with electronics dominating the arrangements and giving the music a smoother, more refined sound. Two companion EPs, MADLO: Influences (a covers album) and MADLO: Remixes, arrived in June 2021. While the COVID-19 pandemic prevented Car Seat Headrest from touring extensively in support of the album, in 2022 they were back to performing live, and they played a three-night stand at New York's Brooklyn Steel in March of that year. The shows were recorded, and a collection of highlights from the concerts was released in December 2023, Faces from the Masquerade. ~ Mark Deming"

Although Toledo would continue to make his first four LPs available through his online store, he sheepishly included a warning to potential customers that they were \"not very good.\" December 2010 brought Little Pieces of Paper with \"No\" Written on Them, which Toledo described as \"B-sides and rarities and generally just awful shit,\" but with March 2011's My Back Is Killing Me Baby, Toledo finally made an album he felt didn't require a warning about its inferior quality, and Car Seat Headrest began winning the attention of critics and lo-fi fans around the world with Twin Fantasy, released in November 2011.\r\nThe year 2012 brought two more albums, Monomania and Starving While Living, and in August 2013, Toledo released Nervous Young Man. Deciding he needed to break away from the places where he grew up and studied, Toledo left Virginia and moved to Seattle, where he assembled a new lineup of Car Seat Headrest and continued to busy himself with home recording. October 2014 brought another particularly personal project, How to Leave Town, which earned enthusiastic reviews on the music blogosphere and led to Toledo signing a deal with Matador Records. The label issued Teens of Style, featuring new versions of several of Car Seat Headrest's older tunes, in October 2015.\r\nIn May 2016, Toledo released an album of new Car Seat Headrest material, Teens of Denial. The record, which melded lo-fi noisemaking with a clean and ambitious production, made music news headlines shortly before its release. One of the album's tracks, \"Just What I Needed/Not What I Needed,\" interpolated a few bars of the Cars' classic \"Just What I Needed.\" At the last minute, Cars frontman and songwriter Ric Ocasek rescinded his permission for Car Seat Headrest to use the excerpt from his song. The initial run of Teens of Denial on vinyl and CD had to be destroyed, but the digital version of the album was released as scheduled, with the problematic track replaced with a reworked version of \"Not What I Needed.\" The album received widespread acclaim, serving as a breakout for Toledo.\r\nCuriously, he returned in early 2018 not with a new LP but with an entirely re-recorded version of Car Seat Headrest's fan-favorite 2011 album Twin Fantasy. The following year saw the release of the group's first concert LP, Commit Yourself Completely. 2020's Making a Door Less Open found Toledo shifting stylistic gears, with electronics dominating the arrangements and giving the music a smoother, more refined sound. Two companion EPs, MADLO: Influences (a covers album) and MADLO: Remixes, arrived in June 2021. While the COVID-19 pandemic prevented Car Seat Headrest from touring extensively in support of the album, in 2022 they were back to performing live, and they played a three-night stand at New York's Brooklyn Steel in March of that year. The shows were recorded, and a collection of highlights from the concerts was released in December 2023, Faces from the Masquerade. ~ Mark Deming"

Cutting his teeth creating D.I.Y. recordings on inexpensive home equipment, Toledo's songwriting -- deeply personal, sometimes dramatic, frequently witty, and dotted with unexpected social and cultural references -- was what stood out as he gained confidence and strength on self-released early projects such as 2010's Little Pieces of Paper with \"No\" Written on Them. 2011's Twin Fantasy was Car Seat Headrest's breakthrough work, a song cycle that was a major step forward for the young songwriter. 2015's Teens of Style was the group's first album for Matador Records, and though the LP earned positive reviews, it was 2016's Teens of Denial that seriously wowed critics and established him as an artist to watch in indie rock. 2020's Making a Door Less Open was an effort to expand the boundaries of Car Seat Headrest's music, with lo-fi indie sounds giving way to a more expert approach dominated by electronic instrumentation.

  "Summary": "Crafting moody and introspective lo-fi pop tunes that are melodic but structurally ambitious at the same time, Car Seat Headrest is the moniker used by musician and songwriter Will Toledo. Cutting his teeth creating D.I.Y. recordings on inexpensive home equipment, Toledo's songwriting -- deeply personal, sometimes dramatic, frequently witty, and dotted with unexpected social and cultural references -- was what stood out as he gained confidence and strength on self-released early projects such as 2010's Little Pieces of Paper with \"No\" Written on Them. 2011's Twin Fantasy was Car Seat Headrest's breakthrough work, a song cycle that was a major step forward for the young songwriter. 2015's Teens of Style was the group's first album for Matador Records, and though the LP earned positive reviews, it was 2016's Teens of Denial that seriously wowed critics and established him as an artist to watch in indie rock. 2020's Making a Door Less Open was an effort to expand the boundaries of Car Seat Headrest's music, with lo-fi indie sounds giving way to a more expert approach dominated by electronic instrumentation. It was a process they continued on the 2021 companion EP's MADLO: Influences and MADLO: Remixes, and the 2022 tour which reflected their new sound was documented on the live album Faces from the Masquerade, issued in December 2023.\nWill Toledo grew up in Leesburg, Virginia, where he learned about music theory while playing in the student symphony band in junior high and high school. He majored in English in college but was fascinated with music, embracing an eclectic variety of artists from Radiohead, Modest Mouse, and R.E.M. to Animal Collective and Swans, and he began writing songs on his computer, using its built-in microphone and the recording software that was bundled with the machine. While Toledo's recording setup became more advanced with time, he continued to prefer simpler solutions to recording problems, and his project became known as Car Seat Headrest when Toledo found he was more comfortable recording vocals in his car than in his home. As he began playing live shows with a rotating team of musicians (when a reporter asked Toledo about being a fixture on the local scene, he replied, \"All that amounts to is being able to play at the local pizza place\"), the vast majority of his recordings were cut at home with Toledo handling all the vocals and instruments himself.\r\nIn May 2010, he issued his first Car Seat Headrest album, titled 1, with 2, 3, and 4 all appearing within the next three months. Although Toledo would continue to make his first four LPs available through his online store, he sheepishly included a warning to potential customers that they were \"not very good.\" December 2010 brought Little Pieces of Paper with \"No\" Written on Them, which Toledo described as \"B-sides and rarities and generally just awful shit,\" but with March 2011's My Back Is Killing Me Baby, Toledo finally made an album he felt didn't require a warning about its inferior quality, and Car Seat Headrest began winning the attention of critics and lo-fi fans around the world with Twin Fantasy, released in November 2011.\r\nThe year 2012 brought two more albums, Monomania and Starving While Living, and in August 2013, Toledo released Nervous Young Man. Deciding he needed to break away from the places where he grew up and studied, Toledo left Virginia and moved to Seattle, where he assembled a new lineup of Car Seat Headrest and continued to busy himself with home recording. October 2014 brought another particularly personal project, How to Leave Town, which earned enthusiastic reviews on the music blogosphere and led to Toledo signing a deal with Matador Records. The label issued Teens of Style, featuring new versions of several of Car Seat Headrest's older tunes, in October 2015.\r\nIn May 2016, Toledo released an album of new Car Seat Headrest material, Teens of Denial. The record, which melded lo-fi noisemaking with a clean and ambitious production, made music news headlines shortly before its release.

  "Summary": "Greece-based Kristine is one of the most famous retrowave/synthwave singers and producers out there — and certainly the most famous woman in that group — but with her new self-titled debut album, there’s a chance she could cross over into the mainstream. Her solo songs such as “The Deepest Blue” and “Modern Love” are nouveau classics of 80s retrosynth, and her vocal spots on songs by the likes of FM Attack, Futurecop!, and Kung Fury’s Mitch Murder have ensured her genre legacy is etched into stone. She can write great hooks and sing great melodies with earnest emotion. On her new album, which includes “Blue,” “Love,” and some other previously released songs along with some new ones, Kristine kicks that 80s pop template into overdrive. These are the songs your synth-skeptic friends will be playing repeatedly for months, if anything because of their genetic similarities to the best of 80s-era Heart and Pat Benatar. It’s pure and honest pop hooks bathed in 80s nostalgia. The Modern Love EP, from which two cuts on the album are derived, came out four years ago. Along the way, her vocals have graced Futurecop!’s classic “Superheroes,” Murder’s “Summer of Heat,” Dance with the Dead’s “The Power,” two songs on FM Attack’s brilliant Deja Vu, and other compositions. Then last year came “The Deepest Blue,” one of her most popular songs and another from the past that shows up on her debut album. She wrote, recorded, and produced the album primarily in her home studio in Athens, but synthwave fans will notice some familiar styles from her global cadre of collaborators. American SelloRekT/LA Dreams, Israeli and Kung Fury star Highway Superstar, Britain-based Sunglasses Kid and Belgian Diana Gitallog all played synthesizer parts from their homes all over the world. A Danish band called The Surf School Dropouts contributed harmonies to a song as well. Local Greeks also lent the talented producer a hand. John Bitzios and Alexandros Solomozis played guitar solos and Ilias Papadopoulos played a saxophone solo, according to Kristine. Read more on Last.fm.

These are the songs your synth-skeptic friends will be playing repeatedly for months, if anything because of their genetic similarities to the best of 80s-era Heart and Pat Benatar. It’s pure and honest pop hooks bathed in 80s nostalgia. The Modern Love EP, from which two cuts on the album are derived, came out four years ago. Along the way, her vocals have graced Futurecop!’s classic “Superheroes,” Murder’s “Summer of Heat,” Dance with the Dead’s “The Power,” two songs on FM Attack’s brilliant Deja Vu, and other compositions. Then last year came “The Deepest Blue,” one of her most popular songs and another from the past that shows up on her debut album. She wrote, recorded, and produced the album primarily in her home studio in Athens, but synthwave fans will notice some familiar styles from her global cadre of collaborators. American SelloRekT/LA Dreams, Israeli and Kung Fury star Highway Superstar, Britain-based Sunglasses Kid and Belgian Diana Gitallog all played synthesizer parts from their homes all over the world. A Danish band called The Surf School Dropouts contributed harmonies to a song as well. Local Greeks also lent the talented producer a hand. John Bitzios and Alexandros Solomozis played guitar solos and Ilias Papadopoulos played a saxophone solo, according to Kristine. Read more on Last.fm.

  "Summary": "Greece-based Kristine is one of the most famous retrowave/synthwave singers and producers out there — and certainly the most famous woman in that group — but with her new self-titled debut album, there’s a chance she could cross over into the mainstream. Her solo songs such as “The Deepest Blue” and “Modern Love” are nouveau classics of 80s retrosynth, and her vocal spots on songs by the likes of FM Attack, Futurecop!, and Kung Fury’s Mitch Murder have ensured her genre legacy is etched into stone. She can write great hooks and sing great melodies with earnest emotion. On her new album, which includes “Blue,” “Love,” and some other previously released songs along with some new ones, Kristine kicks that 80s pop template into overdrive.

  "Summary": "Real Estate helped usher in a warm, hazy style of indie rock that came into prominence in the late 2000s and continue to ply a similar sound, though with a more mature outlook. The band's breezy melodies, jangly guitars, relaxed vocals, and generally laid-back approach to songcraft hid musical complexities on standout albums like 2014's Atlas. As the years went on, their original lineup splintered and new songs explored getting older, parenthood, and a new wealth of  topics, still delivered in the band's reserved, mellow style on albums released in the 2020s like The Main Thing and Daniel.\r\nReal Estate was formed in Ridgewood by lead singer/guitarist Martin Courtney (Predator Vision and formerly Titus Andronicus), guitarist Matthew Mondanile (Ducktails), bassist Alex Bleeker (Alex Bleeker & the Freaks), and drummer Etienne Duguay (Predator Vision). The foursome had played together -- including in a Weezer cover band -- during high school, but didn't become Real Estate until Courtney returned to the Garden State after attending college in Olympia, Washington. After forming in the summer of 2008, the band began playing live that fall and released the \"Suburban Beverage\" 7\", which introduced Real Estate's brand of surfy, lo-fi pop, early in 2009. A song on the Underwater Peoples Records Showcase and the Fake Blues EP appeared that summer. The band spent the fall touring with Girls before their self-titled debut was released by Woodsist.\r\nThe quartet joined the Domino Records roster in 2011 for its sophomore effort, Days, which hit the shelves and the Billboard charts in the rock, alternative, independent, and vinyl albums categories. It reached number 52 on the Billboard 200. Shortly following its release, the band went through a lineup change with Duguay dropping out; he was replaced by drummer Jackson Pollis. The group was also joined at that point by auxiliary member Jonah Maurer on keyboards and additional guitars. This new assemblage of Real Estate toured feverishly for the well-received Days, though by their return in 2014 with third album Atlas, Maurer had been replaced by Matt Kallman. That LP went on to rank higher on all the same charts, landing in the Billboard 200's Top 40. Following a short break for other projects, including Courtney's solo debut, in May of 2016 Real Estate announced that Mondanile was leaving the band to focus on Ducktails. He was replaced by Julian Lynch, and the quintet of Courtney, Bleeker, Pollis, Kallman, and Lynch released In Mind in March 2017. Three years later they returned with their fifth studio album The Main Thing, which explored themes of growing up mixed with a healthy fear of an oncoming apocalypse. The Main Thing was preceded by first single \"Paper Cup,\"  which featured guest vocals from Amelia Meath of Sylvan Esso. Pollis left the band in 2020 and the next year the Half a Human EP gathered together material that the band had begun recording during the sessions for The Main Thing and finished later. Drummer Sammi Niss stepped in to replace Pollis, and this lineup of Real Estate recorded sixth studio album Daniel. The album was released in February of 2024. ~ Heather Phares & Marcy Donelson"

  "Summary": "Real Estate helped usher in a warm, hazy style of indie rock that came into prominence in the late 2000s and continue to ply a similar sound, though with a more mature outlook. The band's breezy melodies, jangly guitars, relaxed vocals, and generally laid-back approach to songcraft hid musical complexities on standout albums like 2014's Atlas. As the years went on, their original lineup splintered and new songs explored getting older, parenthood, and a new wealth of  topics, still delivered in the band's reserved, mellow style on albums released in the 2020s like The Main Thing and Daniel.\r\nReal Estate was formed in Ridgewood by lead singer/guitarist Martin Courtney (Predator Vision and formerly Titus Andronicus), guitarist Matthew Mondanile (Ducktails), bassist Alex Bleeker (Alex Bleeker & the Freaks), and drummer Etienne Duguay (Predator Vision). The foursome had played together -- including in a Weezer cover band -- during high school, but didn't become Real Estate until Courtney returned to the Garden State after attending college in Olympia, Washington. After forming in the summer of 2008, the band began playing live that fall and released the \"Suburban Beverage\" 7\", which introduced Real Estate's brand of surfy, lo-fi pop, early in 2009. A song on the Underwater Peoples Records Showcase and the Fake Blues EP appeared that summer. The band spent the fall touring with Girls before their self-titled debut was released by Woodsist.\r\nThe quartet joined the Domino Records roster in 2011 for its sophomore effort, Days, which hit the shelves and the Billboard charts in the rock, alternative, independent, and vinyl albums categories. It reached number 52 on the Billboard 200. Shortly following its release, the band went through a lineup change with Duguay dropping out; he was replaced by drummer Jackson Pollis. The group was also joined at that point by auxiliary member Jonah Maurer on keyboards and additional guitars. This new assemblage of Real Estate toured feverishly for the well-received Days, though by their return in 2014 with third album Atlas, Maurer had been replaced by Matt Kallman. That LP went on to rank higher on all the same charts, landing in the Billboard 200's Top 40. Following a short break for other projects, including Courtney's solo debut, in May of 2016 Real Estate announced that Mondanile was leaving the band to focus on Ducktails. He was replaced by Julian Lynch, and the quintet of Courtney, Bleeker, Pollis, Kallman, and Lynch released In Mind in March 2017. Three years later they returned with their fifth studio album The Main Thing, which explored themes of growing up mixed with a healthy fear of an oncoming apocalypse. The Main Thing was preceded by first single \"Paper Cup,\"  which featured guest vocals from Amelia Meath of Sylvan Esso.

  "ReleaseDate": "2025-04-28",
  "Summary": "Working as a solo act and in a number of bands and side projects, Ty Segall has released dozens of albums that have helped to define and establish the parameters of garage punk for his generation. Not content to stick to one specific style or sound, he's also ventured into hard rock, folk-rock, and heavy metal, used instruments ranging from synthesizers to xylophones, and made solo records played on acoustic guitars. Depending on the album, Segall can sound raw (2016's Emotional Mugger) or refined (2013's Sleeper), and he's capable of focused one-man-band efforts (2009's Lemons) as well as sprawling and eclectic releases with a range of collaborators (2018's Freedom's Goblin). He proves just as compelling when stripping back the noise and adding synths, as on 2021's Harmonizer, composing film music in classic style (2022's Whirlybird), or recording at home on his own (2022's subdued Hello, Hi and 2024's all-percussion Love Rudiments). No matter the sonic setting, Segall's strong melodic frameworks, creative restlessness, and the infectious intensity of his songs and performances are the constants in his ever-evolving discography.\r\nTy Segall first garnered public acclaim as the lead singer of Orange County, California garage rock revivalists the Epsilons. With that band, he practiced a rawer, snottier take on Strokes/Vines/White Stripes-style rock, occasionally delving into more retro territory. When that band splintered, he struck out on his own and started cranking out lo-fi albums, beginning with a self-titled effort on Castle Face in 2008. On his solo album Lemons, however, Segall delivered a much more traditional sound, studiously re-creating '60s guitar tones and drenching his tracks in old-school reverb. The stomping results bore a striking resemblance to early garage masters such as the Sonics and the Standells, as well as proto-punks the Stooges and bedroom folk antecedent Alexander \"Skip\" Spence. He returned in 2010 with Melted.\r\nThe year 2011 was busy for him, with two albums -- Live in Aisle Five and Goodbye Bread -- scheduled for release, as well as an EP of T. Rex covers, Ty-Rex. Goodbye Bread marked a turn toward Segall's softer side, evoking a John Lennon-like take on quieter and more introspective singer/songwriter fare. In 2012, Segall collaborated with Strange Boys' offshoot White Fence on Hair. This mini-album married Segall's Beatles-soaked pop hooks and production with White Fence's Syd Barrett-influenced, acid-damaged garage sounds. Two more Segall albums followed that year, including June's Slaughterhouse with the Ty Segall Band on In the Red, and Twins, the completely solo follow-up to Goodbye Bread released on Drag City in October.\r\nSegall's profile grew, and 2013 began with several reissues of previous projects, including a 2009 collaboration with Mikal Cronin entitled Reverse Shark Tank, as well as his earlier garage trio the Traditional Fools' out of print 2008 debut. In 2013, Segall also released the debut album from his side project Fuzz, in which he played drums rather than guitar. Also in 2013, he showed off a new approach, recording a departure from the usual and titling it Sleeper -- all of the songs were acoustic ballads. Not one to rest on his laurels, Segall returned to the studio to record the 17-track follow-up Manipulator in 2014, released by Drag City in August. A live concert by the Ty Segall Band at the San Francisco club the Rickshaw Stop was released in February 2015 as part of the Live in San Francisco album series from Castle Face. Another live recording of Segall and his band, preserving his set at the 2013 Pickathon Festival, was released in May 2015 as a split album with the garage/psych act King Tuff, who were also taped at the same event. The year 2015 also saw the arrival of the second Fuzz album, and an expanded reissue of the Ty-Rex EP.\r\nSegall kept up his usual frantic pace the next year, releasing the Emotional Mugger album in January, then touring behind it extensively. He also formed the band Gøggs, with Fuzz's Charles Moothart and Chris Shaw of Ex-Cult. They released a self-titled album in July. The next Ty Segall album was a self-titled effort in early 2017 on Drag City, recorded at Steve Albini's studio and featuring a full band that included longtime collaborator Mikal Cronin and the Cairo Gang's Emmett Kelly on guitar and vocals. Well-received, the album reached number ten on Billboard's Top Independent Albums chart. In early 2018, the prolific Segall brought out Freedom's Goblin, a 19-song album that reunited him with Albini, Cronin, and Kelly, while expanding his sound with the use of a horn section, then released Joy a few months later -- a collaboration with old running mate White Fence on a batch of off-kilter psych rock songs. In October 2018, Segall released Fudge Sandwich, in which he put his own unique spin on 11 cover tunes, interpreting artists ranging from Funkadelic to the Grateful Dead. The same month, he also brought out a low-key cassette-only release, Orange Rainbow, created in a run of just 55 copies for sale at a show of his visual art at a Los Angeles gallery. In January 2018, two live shows in Los Angeles on the tour supporting Freedom's Goblin were recorded by Steve Albini. Highlights from the concerts were released in March 2019 on the album Deforming Lobes, credited to Ty Segall & Freedom Band.\r\nAfter indulging his rock side on most of his 2018 releases, Segall took a detour with First Taste, released in August 2019, which was more clearly informed by vintage pop and folk-rock sounds. While stuck at home in 2020, he took the opportunity to record an EP of Harry Nilsson songs, which was released in March under the title Segall Smeagol. He also spent time recording with his usual band of cohorts (Cronin, Kelly, Moothart, and keyboardist Ben Boye), working separately for the most part. Denée Segall of Lamps also joined the session, writing and singing on two songs. The resulting Harmonizer was co-produced by Cooper Crain of Bitchin Bajas and is the first album done at Segall's recently constructed Harmonizer Studios. The record, the cleanest, most synth-heavy entry in his catalog, was released by Drag City in August 2021.\r\nHis first soundtrack album, Whirlybird, appeared in early 2022; the film, a documentary about reporters who chased stories in helicopters in the 1980s and '90s, inspired Segall to explore a less rock-oriented sound, with keyboards, percussion, and sometimes strings dominating the music. Following the experimentation of Whirlybird, 2022's Hello, Hi was a shift back to a simpler approach, with Segall handling all instruments and vocals himself, primarily using acoustic guitars and layered harmonies. While he seemed busy enough with his own projects, he made time to work with friends and fellow musicians he admired. He contributed instrumental performances to albums by Shannon Lay (2021's Geist) and Bonnie \"Prince\" Billy & Bill Callahan (2022's Blind Date Party); produced recordings for Grave Flowers Bongo Band (2021's Strength of Spring) and SASAMI (2022's Squeeze); and collaborated with Cory Hanson on the 2021 single \"She's a Beam\" b/w \"Milk Bird Flyer.\" Given Segall's prolific nature, it surprised some that he didn't release an album in 2023, though an intimate live performance with Emmett Kelly from July 2022 resulted in an EP, Live at Worship, while Segall produced and engineered an album for Flat Worms, 2023's Witness Marks. Segall was back in action with the January 2024 release of Three Bells, a set of psychedelic-leaning folk-rock-influenced songs reinforced with electric guitar freakouts. It was recorded at Segall's Harmonizer Studio, where he handled most of the instrumentation himself. Also recorded there and released in August of 2024 was Love Rudiments, an all percussion album. On it, Segall traces a relationship from beginning to end using a drum kit, synth drums, tympani, woodblocks, tambourine, xylophone, and many more types of percussion. ~ Pemberton Roach & Mark Deming"
